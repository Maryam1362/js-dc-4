Final Project Ideas:


1. A health Care application: this application is a Case Management reference guide

we get the data(hospitals) for the there different network categories : A,B and C

each category has a list of hospitals with some parameters: such as: "Payer, Admissions, Beds, Contracts, Primary Service"

User wants to be able to enter or selects from the related parameters and find out the best match of the hospital. (The filtered out data will be displayed as output)

I am thinking about coding this with a JS frame work, possibly angular


2.Review book application (User enters the book that she reads and others can write comment or add like or dislike)

3. Travel review application (user would be able to put a pin on the spots that she has been and then writes a review about that place.)

It can be either US map or world map...
